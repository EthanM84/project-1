Possible questions to analyze:

1. How does education level of the mother influence the birth rate (by state)?
2. How does the average age of the mother influence birth rate (by state)?
3. How does another factor (such as crime rate) influence birth rate (by state)?
    a. Would need to bring in an outside dataset/API for this one

Other questions we could consider (these I came up with just looking at the data provided in the CSV):
1. Is there a trend between mother's education level and baby weight?
2. Average baby weight compared to mother's age?
3. Number of births per each state (by year)?
4. Birth rate over the years?

Let me know if you guys come up with any other questions we could potentially analyze, or just note them here. We can narrow them down in class, or do all of them lol
